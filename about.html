		<h3> What is this? </h3>
		<p>A walkable path from San Francisco to New York City is about 2918 miles, and I'm going to walk that distance on my treadmill on stream. I am a Tread Man Walking.</p> 
		<h3> Who are you?</h3>
		<p>I'm Shawn, also known as RitzPlays on the Internet. I'm 21 and live in San Francisco. I am a streamer and Youtuber who plans to walk 2918 miles while streaming myself playing games on Twitch. I'll be playing PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Wii games. </p>
		<h3> Why are you doing this? </h3>
		<p>Each month I am walking, I will be raising money for a different charity. To start things off for January we will be benefiting Child's Play! Click the donate button to donate to them!</p>
		<h3>What can I do?</h3>
		<p>Donate if you can. Click on the map tab to view the map and see the path. If I'm walking through a city/town near you, click the "Contact" button and email me so I can ask you a few questions about the area and possibly interview you on stream!</p>
